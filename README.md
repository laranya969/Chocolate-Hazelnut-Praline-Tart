                CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT PRALINE TART

This is an unadulterated and pure recipe for everyones treasured Hazelnut tart with a hit of chocolate in it.
You can enjoy this tart with coffee or tea in the evening or even as a desert after lunch or dinner.
It is important that your hazelnuts are blanched, primarily because the brown skin covering the nuts make the overall flavour very bitter, almost like the nut has gone off. Getting pre-blanched hazelnuts will save you time in preparing this tart, but if not, follow Willow Arienâ€™s most excellent and effective way of removing hazelnut skins. Following this method, once the skins are off, all you need to do is either give them a roast in the oven to dry them out.
